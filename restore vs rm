### `git restore --staged <filename>`

- **Purpose:** Used to unstage a file, meaning it removes changes from the staging area but keeps them in the working directory.
- **Effect:**
  - The file's changes remain in the working directory.
  - The file is removed from the staging area, so the changes won't be included in the next commit.
  - It essentially reverts the effect of `git add <filename>`.
- **Use Case:** If you've added a file to the staging area with `git add` but want to remove it from the staging area without losing the changes you made to the file.

```bash
git restore --staged <filename>
```

### `git rm --cached <filename>`

- **Purpose:** Used to remove a file from the staging area and stop tracking it in the repository, while keeping the file in the working directory.
- **Effect:**
  - The file is removed from the staging area.
  - The file is also removed from version control (i.e., it will no longer be tracked by Git in future commits).
  - The file itself is not deleted from the working directory; it just becomes an untracked file.
- **Use Case:** When you want to remove a file from version control (stop tracking it) but keep the file in your working directory.

```bash
git rm --cached <filename>
```

### Key Differences

- **Tracking:** `git rm --cached` stops Git from tracking the file entirely, whereas `git restore --staged` keeps the file tracked but unstaged.
- **File State:** After `git rm --cached`, the file becomes untracked; after `git restore --staged`, the file remains tracked but is not staged for commit.
- **Use Case:** Use `git restore --staged` to simply unstage a file but continue tracking it. Use `git rm --cached` to untrack a file without deleting it from your working directory.
